// This is a placeholder for SQL functions that need to be created in the database
// For tracking likes, we need to execute the following SQL to create RPC functions:

/*
-- Function to increment the likes count for a project
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION increment_likes(project_id UUID)
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
  UPDATE projects
  SET likes = COALESCE(likes, 0) + 1
  WHERE id = project_id;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Function to decrement the likes count for a project
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION decrement_likes(project_id UUID)
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
  UPDATE projects
  SET likes = GREATEST(COALESCE(likes, 0) - 1, 0)
  WHERE id = project_id;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
*/

// The above SQL should be executed in the Supabase SQL editor
// Then, these functions can be called using the supabase.rpc() method as used in projectService.ts
